# üåü Advanced RAG Chatbot with Generative Agentic AI

## ü§ñ Overview

Welcome to the **Advanced RAG Chatbot with Generative Agentic AI**! This project is an innovative conversational agent designed to interact with users in a natural and engaging way. By combining advanced techniques in artificial intelligence, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this chatbot can provide intelligent responses that are not only accurate but also contextually relevant. Whether you are looking for information, assistance, or just a friendly chat, this chatbot is here to help!

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üìö Smart Research + Creative Answers
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: This feature allows the chatbot to search for and retrieve relevant information from a database or knowledge base. It then combines this information with its own generative capabilities to provide answers that are both precise and contextually appropriate.

- **Generative AI**: Our chatbot uses cutting-edge language models that can generate responses that sound like they were written by a human. This means you can expect conversations that feel natural and engaging.

- **Context Awareness**: The chatbot is designed to remember the context of the conversation. This means it can keep track of what you‚Äôve talked about, making the interaction feel more coherent and personalized.

- **Customizable**: The chatbot can be easily adapted to fit different needs and industries. Whether you want it to assist with customer service, provide educational content, or engage in casual conversation, it can be tailored to suit your requirements.

- **Multi-Modal Input**: You can interact with the chatbot in various ways. It supports text input for writing essays and poems, as well as answering questions based on the context you provide. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## üîß Technologies Used

To build this advanced chatbot, we utilized several powerful technologies:

- **Python**: A versatile programming language that is widely used in AI and machine learning.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Streamlit**: A tool that allows us to create interactive web applications easily.
- **Langchain**: A framework that helps in building applications with language models.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides access to state-of-the-art language models for generating responses.
- **Ollama**: A tool that aids in managing and deploying machine learning models.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, which helps in retrieving relevant information quickly.
- **dotenv**: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file, making it easier to manage configuration settings.

### üèÅ Prerequisites

Before you can use the Advanced RAG Chatbot, you will need to ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.12**: Make sure you have this version of Python installed on your computer. Python is the programming language used to develop the chatbot.

- **OpenAI Account**: You will need an account with OpenAI or access to a suitable generative model. This is necessary for the chatbot to generate responses.

## üîß For Non-Technical Users

If you're not a developer but want to understand how this works:

1. **It's like having two brains in one system**:
   - One brain quickly searches for facts
   - The other brain formulates nice-sounding answers

2. **Learns from documents**:
   - You can "teach" it by adding documents
   - It will use these to answer questions more accurately

3. **Gets better over time**:
   - Remembers conversation history
   - Adjusts responses based on feedback
