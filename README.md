## 🔧 For Non-Technical Users

If you're not a developer but want to understand how this works:

1. **It's like having two brains in one system**:
   - One brain quickly searches for facts
   - The other brain formulates nice-sounding answers

2. **Learns from documents**:
   - You can "teach" it by adding documents
   - It will use these to answer questions more accurately

3. **Gets better over time**:
   - Remembers conversation history
   - Adjusts responses based on feedback
